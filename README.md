Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm a passionate fullâ€‘stack developer who loves building scalable systems and exploring the world of machine learning and deep learning.
With over four years of experience, I enjoy working across the stackâ€”from designing robust backâ€‘end architectures in Java to crafting intuitive frontâ€‘end interfaces with JavaScript. My toolkit spans multiple languages and frameworks, allowing me to choose the best tools for the job.
ðŸ›  Skills
Languages: Java, Python, C/C++, JavaScript
Frameworks & Libraries: Spring Boot, Django, Flask, FastAPI, Node.js
Frontâ€‘End Frameworks: ReactJS, AngularJS, Next.js
Machine Learning & Deep Learning: Experience building predictive models and experimenting with neural networks to solve realâ€‘world problems
ðŸš€ About My Work
I enjoy translating business requirements into logical program designs, writing clean code, and building APIs and microservices that are scalable and efficient. Whether itâ€™s designing a backend with Spring Boot or spinning up a quick API with Flask or FastAPI, I strive to deliver solutions that perform well and are easy to maintain.
ðŸ“š Machine Learning & AI
Alongside fullâ€‘stack development, I'm deeply interested in machine learning and deep learning. I actively work on projects that involve data analysis, model training, and deploying ML models into production environments.
ðŸŽ¯ What I'm Looking For
I'm currently looking for software developer and AI/ML roles where I can leverage my skills in Java, Python, and modern frameworks to build impactful products and solutions. If you're working on something exciting and need a developer with a strong foundation in both fullâ€‘stack development and machine learning, feel free to reach out!
Thanks for stopping by, and happy coding! ðŸ’»
